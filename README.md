Heros
=====

Village Heros is a Minecraft Bukkit server plugin that adds a small minigame in which the player is rewarded for protecting villagers.

To compile, run in Eclipse as a Maven Install, and copy the generated Jar file to the plugins directory of your Bukkit server.

The minigame allows players to claim villagers when they are nearby, marking them with the player's name. Any monsters that then target a player's villager are marked as a rival to that player. Points are awarded for each rival monster killed, and points are deducted for each villager killed.
